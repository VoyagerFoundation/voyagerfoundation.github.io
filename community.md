## Community

Voyager foundation seeks to take humanity's greatest problems and empower people to collaborate towards solutions and a brighter future. Our method of doing so is to open communication channels between interested volunteers and experts. By creating a pool of human knowledge interconnected by the desire to see a real global impact, we hope to identify worthy causes and support them in their quest and ideas. Using a platform of tools to create communities that can process solutions and meetups, called **Booster pods**, which are set up to allow the discussion to evolve, and for it to inspire and educate people of the endless possibilities available in the world today.
